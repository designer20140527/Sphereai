    {
      id: 2,
      question: "What can creators do on Sphere.ai?",
      answer: "Creators can access AI tools to easily produce video, audio, and written content. They can engage directly with fans, receive $SPH tips and gifts, and unlock advanced features through staking."

      id: 3,
      question: "How can fans participate and earn?",

    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: "What is $SPH used for?",
      answer: "$SPH is the core utility token for Sphere.ai. It can be used for tipping creators, participating in platform events, staking for access boosts, redeeming real-world rewards, and future DAO governance."
    },

      id: 5,
      question: "What's the difference between Sphere Points and $SPH?",
      answer: "Sphere Points are off-chain points earned through engagement and used for in-platform actions. $SPH is an on-chain token with monetary and governance value."

    },
    {
      id: 8,
      question: "Is Sphere.ai free to use?",
      answer: "Yes. The platform is free for creators and fans to join. Additional features and perks can be unlocked through engagement or $SPH usage, but no payment is required to get started."
    },
    {
      id: 9,
      question: "How is user privacy handled?",
      answer: "Sphere.ai uses minimal data collection with end-to-end encryption for key interactions. Decentralized identity (DID) features are planned to allow pseudonymous yet verified participation."
    },
    {
      id: 10,
      question: "When will Sphere.ai be live?",
      answer: "The beta launch is planned for Q2 2025, with core AI tools, $SPH token utility, and creator-fan engagement features available from day one. A full rollout will follow in subsequent roadmap phases."
